# Figure legends

## Figure 1. Ecological shifts associated with CHB severity.
**a,** Integrated study workflow from public registry identifiers to clinical stratification and functional profiling.  
**b,** Comparison of Shannon diversity (species level) between Group M (mild) and Group S (significant) histological damage.  
**c,** Community composition at the phylum level, illustrating individual variation within groups.

## Figure 2. Functional modules and the fermentation landscape.
**a,** Distribution of module scores (sum of relative abundances) across groups.  
**b,** Forest plot of median Δ(S−M) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for pre-specified metabolic modules.  
**c,** Sensitivity analysis comparing conservative and expanded module definitions, highlighting the robustness of fermentation-linked depletion.
**d,** Module dictionary transparency, showing the number of member pathways per module under conservative and expanded definitions.

## Figure 3. Exploratory pathway landscape and taxonomic drivers.
**a,** Volcano plot of unstratified functional pathways, highlighting suggestive features associated with disease severity.  
**b,** Heatmap of top-ranked pathways across samples, ordered by histological group.  
**c,** Taxonomic contribution analysis for selected metabolic pathways, showing the shifting microbial drivers (e.g., *Enterobacteriaceae*) between groups.
**d,** Sensitivity summary of direction-of-effect concordance across external FDR thresholds.

## Figure 4. Directional triangulation across HBV cohorts.
**a,** Comparison of standardized effect sizes for pre-specified modules between the CHB severity comparison (S−M) and an external HBV-cirrhosis cohort (LC−HC).  
**b,** Concordance rates for pathways and modules, illustrating shared functional signatures across disease stages.  
**c,** Quadrant plot showing the agreement in pathway deltas between independent cohorts.
**d,** Concordance rates stratified by external-cohort FDR bins.

## Figure 5. Mechanistic integration and evidence chain.
**a,** Evidence bridge summarizing standardized module effect sizes across cohorts.  
**b,** Driver transparency view highlighting representative concordant pathways and their exploratory FDR values.  
**c,** Mechanistic logic matrix linking module directionality to gut–liver axis pathways and literature anchors.  
**d,** Triangulation workflow summarizing the inferential framework (definition robustness, cross-cohort directionality, mechanistic plausibility).

## Figure S1. Audit and transparency trail.
**a,** Systematic mapping of the analysis pipeline, emphasizing the traceability from raw public data to final figure panels.  
**b,** Inventory of data artifacts and environment snapshots to support the reproducibility of the findings.
