# Figure legends

## Figure 1. Cohort profile and severity-linked ecology.

**a,** Audit-linked cohort flow from registry accessions to analysis-ready run labels (group M vs group S).  
**b,** Shannon diversity (species level) by group, shown as a raincloud distribution with median and interquartile range.  
**c,** Phylum-level relative composition by sample, ordered by group.

## Figure 2. Mechanism-oriented functional modules within CHB severity.

**a,** Per-sample module scores (relative abundance; sum of member pathway relative abundances) shown as horizontal rainclouds for each module.  
**b,** Forest plot of median Δ(S−M) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (5,000 resamples). Annotated with BH-FDR *q* values and group sizes.  
**c,** Definition sensitivity: conservative vs expanded module dictionaries shown as dumbbell deltas.  
**d,** Module dictionary transparency: number of member pathways per module under conservative and expanded definitions.

## Figure 3. Pathway landscape and stratified drivers.

**a,** Enhanced volcano plot for unstratified pathways (delta vs −log10 *p*), highlighting suggestive features.  
**b,** Heatmap of the top-ranked pathways (row z-score) across samples ordered by group.  
**c,** Stratified contribution summary for selected pathways, showing the top between-group taxa contributors (by |Δ|) and their direction.  
**d,** Threshold sensitivity curve illustrating the match rate as an FDR threshold varies (external cohort directionality overlay).

## Figure 4. External directional triangulation.

**a,** Cross-cohort standardized effect sizes for pre-specified modules in the CHB severity cohort (S−M) and an external HBV-related cirrhosis cohort (LC−HC).  
**b,** Direction match rates for modules and pathways.  
**c,** Scatter of pathway deltas between cohorts with quadrants indicating concordant/discordant directions.  
**d,** Direction match rates stratified by external-cohort FDR bins.

## Figure 5. Evidence chain for mechanism-consistent interpretation.

**a,** Evidence bridge: standardized module effect sizes across cohorts emphasizing directional alignment.  
**b,** Driver transparency: selected concordant pathways annotated with exploratory *q* values to foreground statistical strength.  
**c,** Mechanistic logic matrix linking module directionality to canonical gut–liver axis pathways and literature anchors.  
**d,** Triangulation workflow summarizing the inferential framework: definition robustness + cross-cohort directionality + mechanistic plausibility.

## Figure S1. Audit traceability.

**a,** Timeline and provenance for key pipeline stages and artifacts (public sources → derived tables → figures).  
**b,** Inventory of audit artifacts by category to support reviewer verification.
