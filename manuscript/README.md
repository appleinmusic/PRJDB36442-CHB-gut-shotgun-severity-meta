# Manuscript materials

This folder contains draft submission text for the `meta/PRJDB36442` project.

- `manuscript.md`: main IMRaD manuscript (text-only; author/journal placeholders).
- `figure_legends.md`: figure and supplementary figure legends.
- `references.md`: reference list (Vancouver-style).

Notes:
- Raw sequencing data and large reference databases are intentionally excluded from this repository.
- Reproducible figure boards are in `plots/publication/` (PDF/PNG) with per-figure `*.meta.json` provenance.
