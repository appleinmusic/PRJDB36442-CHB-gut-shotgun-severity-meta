## Abstract

**Background:** Gut–liver axis mechanisms are increasingly implicated in chronic hepatitis B (CHB), yet most microbiome studies emphasize diagnosis-based contrasts and provide limited traceability from public repositories to analysis-ready phenotypes.  
**Methods:** We performed a transparent, fully scriptable reanalysis of a public CHB shotgun metagenomics cohort (ENA/DDBJ accession `PRJDB36442`, *n*=20). Histological damage severity was recovered from publicly accessible NGDC records as a binary label (**group M**: mild; **group S**: significant damage) and joined to sequencing runs via a documented audit trail. Taxonomic profiling was performed with MetaPhlAn, and functional profiling with HUMAnN. We prioritized mechanism-oriented functional modules (short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan/indole, LPS/lipid A, bile acid transformation) defined *a priori* as fixed pathway sets. Between-group differences were summarized as median deltas (S−M) with nonparametric testing and FDR control; uncertainty was quantified using bootstrap confidence intervals. External triangulation focused on direction-of-effect concordance with an independent HBV-related cirrhosis metagenomic cohort (LC vs healthy controls).  
**Results:** Compared with group M (9/20), group S (11/20) showed lower within-sample diversity (Shannon median 3.16 vs 3.79; Mann–Whitney *P*=0.0024). In pre-specified module analysis, acetate and lactate/succinate-associated fermentation modules were lower in group S (median Δ(S−M) −0.00248, *q*=0.059; and −0.00144, *q*=0.083, respectively), with consistent direction under a conservative/expanded module definition sensitivity. No individual HUMAnN pathways met conventional FDR thresholds in this cohort; nonetheless, several top-ranked pathways mapped to amino-acid biosynthesis and membrane lipid processes and were enriched for between-group driver shifts in stratified species contributions, including prominent Enterobacteriaceae signatures. Directional triangulation supported concordance for 3/5 pre-specified modules between CHB severity and an external HBV-related cirrhosis cohort, and 54% concordance across pathways overall (62% among pathways significant in the external cohort).  
**Conclusions:** In a public, biopsy-labeled CHB shotgun cohort, greater histological damage severity was associated with reduced diversity and suggestive depletion of fermentation-linked functional modules, with partial directional agreement in an independent HBV-cirrhosis cohort. These results are intentionally constrained to what can be audited from public records, and provide a reproducible starting point for mechanistic and prospective validation.

## Introduction

Despite effective nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy and virological control, a subset of people with CHB continues to exhibit residual hepatic inflammation and progressive fibrotic remodeling. The gut microbiome has been implicated as a modulator of hepatic immune tone through microbial metabolites and microbe-associated molecular patterns that reach the liver via the portal circulation. However, the CHB microbiome literature is dominated by case–control comparisons and marker-based surveys, often with limited functional resolution and limited traceability from public repositories to patient-level stratification.

Shotgun metagenomics offers a direct route to functionally interpretable signals, yet the value of public reanalysis depends on two prerequisites: (i) accessible phenotypes that can be tied to specific samples, and (ii) a defensible strategy for linking compositional shifts to mechanism-oriented hypotheses without overclaiming from small cohorts. Here, we reanalyzed a public CHB shotgun dataset anchored to a biopsy-derived severity label recovered from NGDC records (group M vs group S). We focused on a narrow set of pre-specified, gut–liver-axis-relevant functional modules (SCFA-related fermentation, tryptophan/indole metabolism, LPS/lipid A biosynthesis, bile acid transformation), and we framed external evidence as directional triangulation rather than strict replication.

## Methods

### Study design and public data sources

This is a secondary analysis of publicly available, de-identified sequencing and metadata. The primary cohort comprises 20 paired-end shotgun metagenomes deposited under ENA/DDBJ accession `PRJDB36442` (linked to NGDC BioProject `PRJCA037061` and NGDC GSA `CRA023641`). A complete per-FASTQ URL/size/MD5 manifest is generated by the repository scripts and enables independent verification of inputs.

### Phenotype recovery and audit trail

The analysis label was recovered from public NGDC records as a binary histological damage group: **group M** (mild) and **group S** (significant). The run-to-group mapping is derived from the NGDC export (Excel) and joined to ENA/DDBJ run accessions. All steps are scriptable and documented in the project audit trail (`docs/AUDIT_TRAIL.md`) and phenotype provenance note (`docs/metadata/PRJDB36442_phenotypes.md`).

### Taxonomic profiling and diversity metrics

Taxonomic profiling was performed using MetaPhlAn (version and database recorded in the audit bundle) [1]. Shannon diversity was computed at the species level from the MetaPhlAn output tables. Between-group differences in Shannon diversity were evaluated using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U test.

### Functional profiling and pathway tables

Functional profiling was performed using HUMAnN [2]. Downstream analyses used **unstratified** pathway abundances (i.e., features without a taxonomic “|” suffix), excluding `UNMAPPED` and `UNINTEGRATED`. To avoid conflating sequencing depth with biological variation, each sample’s unstratified pathway abundances were normalized to relative abundance by dividing by the sample’s total unstratified pathway abundance.

### Pre-specified mechanism modules and module scoring

We defined a small set of mechanism-oriented modules *a priori* as fixed sets of HUMAnN pathway features (module dictionaries provided as `module_sets_conservative.tsv` and `module_sets_expanded.tsv`). For each sample, the **module score** was calculated as the sum of member pathway relative abundances. Group differences were summarized as median Δ(S−M) and tested using two-sided Mann–Whitney U tests; Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction was applied within the module family.

### Pathway-level screening and stratified contribution summaries

For descriptive context, we computed pathway-level median deltas (S−M) across all unstratified pathways and applied BH-FDR within the pathway family. Because of limited sample size and multiple-testing burden, pathway-level results were interpreted as exploratory, with direction and rank emphasized over strict thresholding. For selected top-ranked pathways, stratified contribution tables were used to summarize how the taxonomic sources of pathway abundance shifted between groups.

### External triangulation (direction-of-effect concordance)

We evaluated directional concordance of module and pathway effects against an independent HBV-related cirrhosis gut metagenomic cohort (LC vs healthy controls) [8] for which analysis-ready summary tables were derived from the published supplementary materials. Concordance was defined as agreement in the sign of the median delta between the CHB severity comparison (S−M) and the external cohort comparison (LC−HC). This analysis was designed as triangulation of mechanism-consistent directionality rather than strict effect-size replication, given differences in cohort phenotype, geography, and laboratory pipelines.

### Reproducibility and reporting

Analyses were executed using version-controlled scripts with explicit recording of software versions, parameters, and SHA-256 checksums for the canonical input tables used in the final figures. The public repository associated with this manuscript provides: (i) scripts to regenerate download manifests from registry accessions, (ii) provenance for each figure panel, and (iii) a lightweight reproducibility bundle (artifact hashes, environment snapshot, and script sanity checks). Raw FASTQs and large reference databases are intentionally excluded; all public data access points and rerun instructions are documented.

## Results

### Cohort and label provenance

All 20 runs in `PRJDB36442` could be joined to NGDC BioSample records with an explicit group label (M/S). The cohort comprised 9 group M and 11 group S samples. A complete audit trail from registry identifiers to analysis-ready tables is summarized in Figure S1.

### Within-sample diversity declines with greater histological damage

Group S exhibited lower Shannon diversity than group M (median 3.16 vs 3.79; Δ(S−M) −0.62; Mann–Whitney *P*=0.0024; Figure 1b), consistent with a community contraction in the more severely damaged group.

### Mechanism-oriented modules highlight fermentation-linked depletion in group S

In pre-specified module analysis (Figure 2), the acetate module and the lactate/succinate fermentation module showed lower scores in group S (median Δ(S−M) −0.00248, *q*=0.059; and −0.00144, *q*=0.083, respectively). These directions were preserved under an expanded module dictionary sensitivity. Modules representing tryptophan/indole metabolism and LPS/lipid A biosynthesis did not show statistically robust differences in this cohort but contributed to downstream triangulation.

### Pathway landscape: exploratory signals and shifting taxonomic drivers

Across 452 unstratified pathways, no pathway passed conventional FDR thresholds in this cohort, and the smallest pathway-level *q* values clustered around 0.26 (Figure 3a). The top-ranked pathways by nominal significance included amino-acid biosynthesis (arginine/ornithine) and membrane phospholipid-related processes (Figure 3b). Stratified contribution summaries for selected arginine/ornithine pathways suggested that, even when total pathway abundance shifted modestly, the **taxonomic sources** of these pathways differed between groups, with large between-group contrasts attributable to Enterobacteriaceae (notably *Escherichia coli*) and a small set of additional taxa (Figure 3c).

### External triangulation supports partial directional concordance

When compared with an independent HBV-related cirrhosis gut metagenomic cohort (LC vs healthy controls), 3 of 5 pre-specified modules showed concordant direction of effect between CHB severity (S−M) and cirrhosis (LC−HC), including depletion of fermentation-linked modules (Figure 4a). Across pathways, 198 of 366 features (54%) exhibited directional concordance overall, rising to 62% among pathways significant in the external cohort. These findings support the view that a subset of functional shifts observed within CHB severity may align with broader HBV-related liver disease progression, while also highlighting meaningful discordance that likely reflects stage-specific biology and cohort differences.

## Discussion

Using a biopsy-derived severity label recoverable from public metadata, we found that greater histological damage in CHB was associated with reduced gut microbial diversity and a suggestive depletion of fermentation-linked functional modules derived from shotgun metagenomics. While this cohort is small and covariate-limited, it offers an unusual advantage for public reanalysis: the primary stratification can be audited directly from registry records and reproduced from URLs and checksums.

The module-level pattern we observed—reduced acetate and lactate/succinate-associated fermentation in the more severely damaged group—fits broadly with prior work implicating SCFA-linked signaling in barrier function and immune modulation [3,4]. Importantly, we do not interpret these module scores as direct measurements of metabolite concentrations; rather, they represent a functional potential signal embedded in metagenomic pathway profiles. The pathway-level landscape did not yield FDR-robust single-pathway discoveries, emphasizing the need to privilege effect-size direction, pre-specification, and triangulation over post hoc threshold-driven claims in small cohorts.

Our external analysis was intentionally framed as directional triangulation against an independent HBV-related cirrhosis metagenomic cohort. Partial concordance—especially for fermentation-linked modules—supports continuity along an HBV-related disease spectrum, but discordance was also common and should be expected given differences in phenotype (histology severity within CHB vs cirrhosis vs healthy), clinical context, and pipelines. These results motivate two next steps: (i) obtaining richer per-sample clinical covariates for `PRJDB36442` to reduce residual confounding and better interpret mechanisms, and (ii) expanding to additional CHB shotgun cohorts where histology and treatment metadata are available.

### Limitations

First, the primary cohort is small (*n*=20) and public metadata provide only a binary severity label; we could not adjust for age, sex, diet, medications, or laboratory values. Second, functional inference depends on reference databases and computational profiling, and strain-level variation may not be captured. Third, external triangulation compares distinct phenotypes and should not be interpreted as replication of effect size or clinical risk.

## Conclusions

In a public CHB shotgun metagenomic cohort with an auditable biopsy-derived severity label, greater histological damage is associated with lower diversity and suggestive depletion of fermentation-linked functional modules. This work provides a reproducible, review-ready foundation for mechanistic and prospective validation in CHB.
